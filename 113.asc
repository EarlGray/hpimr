//The gibbous moon riding higher in the cloudless sky, the stars and wash of the
//Milky Way visible in all their majesty within the darkness: All these
//illuminated thirty-seven skull masks gleaming above black robes, and the
//darker-clad Lord Voldemort, whose eyes shone red.

// 19025
//“Welcome, my Death Eaters,” spoke Lord Voldemort’s voice, smooth and high and
//terrible. “No, do not look at me, you fools! Eyes upon the Potter child! Ten
//years, it has been, ten years since we last met. Yet you answer my call as
//though it were yesterday…” The Dark Lord Voldemort came near to one hooded
//figure, tapped fingers upon the mask. “In a hastily Transfigured
//__mockery__ of a Death Eater’s true armor, with a childish Charm to
//distort your voice. Explain, Mr. Honor.”

// 19026
//“Our old masks and robes…” said the robe whose mask the Dark Lord had tapped.
//Even through the distorting timbre of the mask, the fear in it was audible.
//“We… we were not fighting in them, Master, with you gone… so I did not maintain
//their enchantments… and then you summoned me to appear here, masked, and I… I
//always held faith in you, Master, but I did not know you would return this very
//day… I am truly sorry to have displeased you…”

// 19027
//“Enough.” The Dark Lord moved on to stand behind another figure, that seemed to
//tremble, though it kept its mask facing the Boy-Who-Lived, and its wand held
//level. “I might think more kindly of such neglect, if you had pursued my agenda
//by other means… Mr. Counsel. Yet I return to find - what? A country conquered
//in my name?” The high voice climbed higher. “No! I find you playing ordinary
//politics in the Wizengamot! I find your brothers still abandoned in Azkaban! It
//is a disappointment to me… I confess myself disappointed… You thought I was
//gone, the Dark Mark dead, and you forsook my purpose. Is that right, Mr.
//Counsel?”

// 19028
//“No, Master!” cried that masked figure. “We knew you would return - but, but we
//could not fight Dumbledore without you -”

// 19029
//“__Crucio.__”

// 19030
//A horrible scream tore out of the mask, piercing the night, it continued for
//long, long seconds.

// 19031
//“Get up,” the Dark Lord said to the figure that had collapsed upon the ground.
//“Keep your wand on Harry Potter. __Do not lie to me again.__”

// 19032
//“Yes, Master,” sobbed the figure, as it pushed itself to its feet.

// 19033
//Voldemort resumed pacing behind the black-robed figures. “I suppose you are
//also wondering what Harry Potter is doing here… Why he is a guest at my
//rebirthing party.”

// 19034
//“I know, Master!” said one of the robes. “You mean to prove your power by
//killing him, in front of us all, to leave no doubt as to which of you is
//stronger! To show how your Killing Curse can slay even this so-called
//Boy-Who-Lived!”

// 19035
//There was a pause. None of the cloaked figures dared to speak.

// 19036
//Slowly, the Dark Lord Voldemort, in his high-collared shirt and dark robes,
//turned to face the Death Eater who had spoken.

// 19037
//“That,” whispered Voldemort in a voice chill as death, “is a little too much
//folly for me to credit, Mr. Sallow. You heard that theory of how I died, and
//tried to provoke me into repeating a mistake?” Lord Voldemort was floating,
//rising high off the ground. “I suppose you came to prefer your laziness to my
//mastery, __Macnair?__”

// 19038
//The Death Eater who’d spoken was suddenly surrounded by a blue haze. He spun,
//slashed his wand at the Dark Lord, and cried “__Avada Kedavra!__”

// 19039
//Voldemort simply tilted to one side in midair, dodging the green bolt.

// 19040
//“__Avada Kedavra!__” cried the Death Eater. His hand that didn’t hold a
//wand was making other gestures, further colors and layers building up in his
//shielding haze with each gesture completed. “Help me, my brothers! If we all -”

// 19041
//The Death Eater fell in seven flaming pieces to the ground, chunks of flesh
//with the cauterized edges still glowing.

// 19042
//“Eyes and wands on Harry Potter, all of you,” Voldemort repeated, his voice low
//and dangerous. “And Macnair acted in sheer stupidity just then, for I command
//your Marks, as I __always__ shall. __I am immortal.__”

// 19043
//“Master,” said another robe. “The girl upon the altar - is she to serve us for
//a Dark Revel? She seems unworthy of such a joyous occasion. I could find
//better, Master, if you give me leave for just a short time -”
//! 17%

// 19044
//“No, Mr. Friendly,” said Voldemort, sounding rather amused. “The little witch
//you see upon the altar is none other than Hermione Granger -”

// 19045
//“What?” cried one of the black robes, and then, “I’m sorry, Master, I’m sorry,
//I beg your -”

// 19046
//“__Crucio.__” This screaming only lasted a few seconds, and Voldemort had
//performed it as though it were perfunctory. Afterward Voldemort’s voice
//returned to low amusement. “I have resurrected this mudblood through the
//Darkest of magics, for my own purposes. You shall not offer her the slightest
//trouble, any of you. You are better off dead than if I learn my little
//experiment came to harm at your hands. This order is absolute, regardless of
//other circumstances - even if she escapes, let us say.” A cold high laugh, as
//if at some joke that nobody else understood.

// 19047
//“Master,” one of the robes said in a faltering voice distorted by his skull
//mask. “Master, please - I would never defy you, I am obedient as you see - but
//Master, I beg you, let me return, the better to serve you later - I came here
//in haste, forsaking - Master, with so many of us being gone, others will
//wonder, they will mark the absences, who has disappeared. Soon there shall be
//no alibi I can offer.”

// 19048
//A cold high laugh. “Ah, Mr. White, the most delinquent of my servants. I have
//not yet decided if you will survive your punishment. I have less need of you
//than I once did, Mr. White. In two days’ time the Death Eaters shall walk
//openly. My powers have increased, and I have just this day disposed of
//Dumbledore.” More gasps of shock arose from the Death Eaters, Voldemort paid
//them no heed. “Tomorrow I shall slay Bones, Crouch, Moody, and Scrimgeour, if
//they have not fled. The rest of you shall go into the Ministry and the
//Wizengamot, and cast Imperius Curses as I direct you. We are __finished__
//waiting. By tomorrow’s nightfall I shall have declared myself Lord Ruler of
//Britain!”

// 19049
//Intakes of breath rose from the gathered masks, but one figure was laughing.

// 19050
//“You find me amusing, Mr. Grim?”

// 19051
//“Apologies, Master,” said the robed figure who had laughed, his wand perfectly
//level upon where Harry stood. “I was glad to hear you had dispatched
//Dumbledore. I fled from Britain in cowardly fear of him, having lost faith in
//your return.”

// 19052
//Voldemort’s chuckle resounded within the graveyard. “Your candor earns you my
//mercy, Mr. Grim. I was surprised to see you here tonight; you are more
//competent than I suspected. But before we turn our attention to happier
//matters, there is a certain affair to which we must attend. Tell me, Mr. Grim,
//if the Boy-Who-Lived swore an oath to you, might you trust him?”

// 19053
//“Master… I don’t understand…” said Mr. Grim. One or two of the other Death
//Eaters turned their masks toward Voldemort before quickly fixing the skull gaze
//on Harry.

// 19054
//“Answer me,” Voldemort hissed. “This is not a trick, Mr. Grim, and you
//__will__ answer truthfully or bear the consequences. You knew the boy’s
//forebears, did you not? Knew them for straightforward folk? If the boy freely
//chose to swear to you an oath, even knowing you for a Death Eater, might you
//trust in his words? Answer me!” Voldemort’s voice rose to a shriek.

// 19055
//“I… yes, Master, I suppose I might…”

// 19056
//“Good,” Voldemort said coldly. “The potential for trust must exist, to be
//sacrificed. And for the bonder of the Unbreakable Vow… which of you shall
//sacrifice their magic? It shall be quite the long Vow… much longer than usual…
//much magic shall be required for that…” Voldemort smiled his awful smile. “Mr.
//White shall do.”

// 19057
//“No, please! __Master, I beg you!__ I served you better than any - as best
//I could -”

// 19058
//“__Crucio,__” said Voldemort, and Mr. White screamed through his mask’s
//distortion for what seemed like a full minute. “Be grateful if I leave you your
//life! Now approach the boy, Mr. Grim, Mr. White. From behind him, idiot! You
//must not block the others’ wands! And the rest of you, you must fire if Harry
//Potter tries to run, even if it means striking at your fellow Death Eaters.”

// 19059
//Mr. White took time to approach, the black robes seeming to shake, even as Mr.
//Grim moved smoothly into position.

// 19060
//“What is to be the Vow, Master?” came the voice of Mr. Grim.

// 19061
//“Ah, yes,” Voldemort said. The Dark Lord went on pacing behind the semicircle
//of Death Eaters. “Today - though I hardly expect even you to believe me - today
//we are doing Merlin’s work, my Death Eaters. Yes! Before us stands a great
//danger, who in his blundering folly has been prophesied to wreak destruction
//such as even I can scarcely imagine. The Boy-Who-Lived! The boy who frightens
//__Dementors!__ The cattle who believe they own this world should have been
//more worried when they saw that. Useless, all of them!”

// 19062
//“Forgive me -” said one black robe in a halting voice. “Master - surely, if
//that is so - Master, why don’t we just kill him right away?”
//! 34%

// 19063
//Voldemort laughed, a strange bitter laugh. When he spoke on his high voice was
//precise. “Here is the oath’s intent, Mr. Grim, Mr. White, Harry Potter. Listen
//well and comprehend the Vow that must be sworn, for its intent is also binding,
//and you three must share an understanding of its meaning. You will swear, Harry
//Potter, not to destroy the world, to take no risks when it comes to not
//destroying the world. This Vow may __not__ force you into any positive
//action, on account of that, this Vow does not force your hand to any stupidity.
//Do you understand that, Mr. Grim, Mr. White? We are dealing with a prophecy of
//destruction. A __prophecy!__ They can fulfill themselves in twisted ways.
//We must be cautious that this Vow itself does not bring that prophecy about. We
//dare not let this Vow force Harry Potter to stand idly after some disaster is
//already set in motion by his hand, because he must take some lesser risk if he
//tries to stop it. Nor must the Vow force him to choose a risk of truly vast
//destruction, over a certainty of lesser destruction. But all Harry Potter’s
//__foolishness,__” Voldemort’s voice climbed, “all his
//__recklessness,__ all his __grandiose schemes__ and __good
//intentions__ - he shall not risk them leading to disaster! He shall not gamble
//with the Earth’s fate! No researches that might lead to catastrophe! No
//unbinding of seals, no opening of gates!” Voldemort’s voice lowered again.
//“Unless this very Vow itself is somehow leading into the destruction of the
//world, in which case, Harry Potter, you must ignore it in that particular
//regard. You will __not__ trust yourself alone in making such a
//determination, you must confide honestly and fully in your trusted friend, and
//see if that one agrees. Such is this Vow’s meaning and intent. It forces only
//such acts as Harry Potter might choose himself, having learned that he is a
//prophesied instrument of destruction. For the capacity for choice must also
//exist, to be sacrificed. Do you understand, Mr. White?”

// 19064
//“I - I think so - oh, Master, __please,__ do not let the Vow be so long -”

// 19065
//“Silence, fool, you do a more useful thing this day than you have ever done.
//Mr. Grim?”

// 19066
//“I think, Master, that it must be repeated to me.”

// 19067
//Voldemort smiled that too-wide smile, and said it all again using different
//words.

// 19068
//“And now,” Voldemort said coldly, “Harry Potter, you will keep your wand low,
//and permit Mr. Grim to touch his wand to yours; and you will speak such words
//as I direct you. If Harry Potter speaks any other word, then cut him down, the
//rest of you.”

// 19069
//“Yes, Master,” came the thirty-four-fold chorus.

// 19070
//Harry was chilled, and shivering, and not only because he was naked in the
//night. He didn’t understand why Voldemort was __not__ just killing him.
//There seemed to be only a single line leading into the future, and it was
//Voldemort’s chosen line, and Harry did not know what came after this.

// 19071
//“Mr. White,” said Voldemort. “Touch your wand to Harry Potter’s hand, and
//repeat these words. Magic that flows in me, bind this Vow.”

// 19072
//Mr. White spoke those words. Even through the distortion effect of his mask, it
//sounded as though his heart were breaking.

// 19073
//Behind Voldemort the obelisks chanted, a language that Harry did not know;
//three times they repeated their words, then fell silent.

// 19074
//“Mr. Grim,” said Voldemort. “Think of the reasons why you might trust this boy,
//if he had given this oath freely. Think of that potential for trust, and
//__sacrifice__ it as you say…”

// 19075
//“By my trust that I hold for you,” said Mr. Grim, “be you held.”

// 19076
//And then it was Harry Potter’s turn to repeat Lord Voldemort’s words, and Harry
//did so.

// 19077
//“I vow…” Harry said. His voice shook, but he spoke. “That I shall not… by any
//act of mine… destroy the world… I shall take no chances… in not destroying the
//world… if my hand is forced… I may take the course… of lesser destruction over
//greater destruction… unless it seems to me that this Vow itself… leads to the
//world’s end… and the friend… in whom I have confided honestly… agrees that this
//is so. By my own free will…” Harry could feel it, as the rite was invoked, the
//shining cords of power wrapping around his wand and Mr. Grim’s wand, wrapping
//around his hand where Mr. White’s wand touched it, wrapping around his
//__self__ on some disturbingly abstract level. Harry could feel himself
//__invoking__ his power of free choice, and he knew that his next words
//would __sacrifice__ it, that this was absolutely the last chance to turn
//back.

// 19078
//“…so shall it be,” said the coldly precise voice of Lord Voldemort.

// 19079
//“…so shall it be,” Harry repeated, and he knew in that moment that the content
//of the Vow was no longer something he could decide whether or not to do, it was
//simply the way in which his body and mind would move. It was not a vow he could
//break even by sacrificing his life in the process. Like water flowing downhill
//or a calculator summing numbers, it was just a thing-Harry-Potter-would-do.
//! 51%

// 19080
//“Did the Vow take, Mr. White?”

// 19081
//Mr. White sounded like he was weeping. “Yes, Master… I have lost so much,
//please, I have been punished enough.”

// 19082
//“Return to your places…” said Voldemort. “Good. All eyes on the Potter child,
//prepare to fire the instant he tries to flee, or raise his wand, or speak any
//word…” The Dark Lord floated high in the air, the black-clad figure overlooking
//the graveyard. Again he held a gun in his left hand, and his wand in his right.
//“Better. __Now__ we shall kill the Boy-Who-Lived.”

// 19083
//Mr. White staggered. Mr. Grim was laughing again, and so were others.

// 19084
//“I did not do that to be funny,” Voldemort said coldly. “We are dealing with a
//__prophecy__, fools. We are snipping the threads of destiny one by one;
//carefully, carefully, not knowing when we may first encounter resistance. This
//is the order in which the next acts shall be done. First Harry Potter shall be
//stunned, then his limbs severed and the wounds cauterized. Mr. Friendly and Mr.
//Honor will examine him for any trace of unusual magics. One of you shall shoot
//the boy many times with my Muggle weapon, and then as many of you as can shall
//strike him with the Killing Curse. Only then will Mr. Grim crush his skull and
//brains with the mundane substance of a tombstone. I shall verify his corpse,
//then his corpse shall be burned with Fiendfyre, then we will exorcise the
//surrounding area in case he has left a ghost. I myself will guard this place
//until six hours have passed, for I do not fully trust the wards I have set
//against Time’s looping; and four of you shall search the surroundings for signs
//of anything noteworthy. Even after that we must remain vigilant for any sign of
//Harry Potter’s renewed presence, in case Dumbledore has left some unimagined
//trick in play. If you can think of any trick that I have missed in being sure
//that Harry Potter’s threat is ended, speak now and I shall reward you
//handsomely… speak now, in Merlin’s name!”

// 19085
//There was stunned silence amid the cemetery; no one made to speak.

// 19086
//“Useless, the lot of you,” Voldemort said with bitter scorn. “Now I shall ask
//Harry Potter one final question, and he is to answer that question for my ears
//alone, in Parseltongue. Strike the boy down at once if he answers with anything
//but hisses, if he tries to speak one word of human speech.” Then Voldemort
//hissed, “__Power I know not, it wass ssaid that you would have. The
//Muggle Artss I have now learned of from you, and I am already sstudying them.
//Your power over life-eaterss musst be comprehended for onesself, or sso you
//ssay. If there iss any other power you posssesss, that I may come to have, tell
//me of it now. Elsse, I intend to torment certain of thosse you care for. Ssome
//livess I have already promissed you, but otherss I did not. Your mudblood
//sservantss in your little army. Your preciouss parentss. All sshall ssuffer for
//what will sseem to them like eternitiess; and then I sshall ssend them, broken,
//into the life-eater prisson to remember it, until they wasste and die. For each
//unknown power you tell me how to masster, or other ssecret you tell me that I
//desire to know, you may name one more of thosse to insstead be protected and
//honored under my reign. Thiss alsso I promisse and intend to keep.__”
//Voldemort’s smiling expression now came through as if it were a snake’s gaping
//fangs, and the meaning that expression bore among snakes, a promise that
//whoever beheld the teeth was to be consumed by them. ”__Wasste not time
//in thoughtss of esscape, if you care for thosse oness. You have ssixty
//ssecondss to begin telling me ssomething I wissh to know, and then your death
//beginss.”__

// 19087
//__This is your final exam.__

// 19088
//__You have 60 hours.__

// 19089
//__Your solution must at least allow Harry to evade immediate death,__

// 19090
//__despite being naked, holding only his wand, facing 36 Death Eaters__

// 19091
//__plus the fully resurrected Lord Voldemort.__

// 19092
//**If a viable solution is posted before**

// 19093
//***12:01AM Pacific Time* (8:01AM UTC) on Tuesday, March 3rd,
//2015,**

// 19094
//**the story will continue to Ch. 121.**

// 19095
//**Otherwise you will get a shorter and sadder ending.**

// 19096
//__Keep in mind the following:__

// 19097
//__1. Harry must succeed via his own efforts. The cavalry is not coming.__

// 19098
//__Everyone who might want to help Harry thinks he is at a Quidditch
//game.__

// 19099
//__2. Harry may only use capabilities the story has already shown him to
//have;__
//! 68%

// 19100
//__he cannot develop wordless wandless Legilimency in the next 60
//seconds.__

// 19101
//__3. Voldemort is evil and cannot be persuaded to be good;__

// 19102
//__the Dark Lord’s utility function cannot be changed by talking to him.__

// 19103
//__4. If Harry raises his wand or speaks in anything except Parseltongue,__

// 19104
//__the Death Eaters will fire on him immediately.__

// 19105
//__5. If the simplest timeline is otherwise one where Harry dies -__

// 19106
//__if Harry cannot reach his Time-Turner without Time-Turned help -__

// 19107
//__then the Time-Turner will not come into play.__

// 19108
//__6. It is impossible to tell lies in Parseltongue.__

// 19109
//__Within these constraints,__

// 19110
//__Harry is allowed to attain his full potential as a rationalist,__

// 19111
//__now in this moment or never,__

// 19112
//__regardless of his previous flaws.__

// 19113
//__Of course ‘the rational solution’,__

// 19114
//__if you are using the word ‘rational’ correctly,__

// 19115
//__is just a needlessly fancy way of saying ‘the best solution’__

// 19116
//__or ‘the solution I like’ or ‘the solution I think we should use’,__

// 19117
//__and you should usually say one of the latter instead.__

// 19118
//__(We only need the word ‘rational’ to talk about ways of thinking,__

// 19119
//__considered apart from any particular solutions.)__

// 19120
//__And by Vinge’s Principle,__

// 19121
//__if you know exactly what a smart mind would do,__

// 19122
//__you must be at least that smart yourself.__

// 19123
//__Asking someone “What would an optimal player think is the best move?”__

// 19124
//__should produce answers no better than “What do you think is best?”__

// 19125
//__So what I mean in practice,__

// 19126
//__when I say Harry is allowed to attain his full potential as a
//rationalist,__

// 19127
//__is that Harry is allowed to solve this problem__

// 19128
//__the way YOU would solve it.__

// 19129
//__If you can tell me exactly how to do something,__

// 19130
//__Harry is allowed to think of it.__

// 19131
//__But it does not serve as a solution to say, for example,__

// 19132
//__“Harry should persuade Voldemort to let him out of the box”__

// 19133
