//There was nothing left to do.
Не було чого робити.

// 16543
//There was nothing left to plan.
Не було що планувати.

// 16544
//There was nothing left to think.
Не було про що думати.

//Into that emptiness rose the new worst memory -
В порожнечі здійнявся новий найгірший спогад...

//The Boy-Who-Lived-Unlike-His-Best-Friend trudged the long, echoing corridors
//toward the Great Hall. With all his energies of thought exhausted, his mind was
//starting to throw out thoughts like an image of Hermione walking beside him and
//wordless concepts like __That will never happen again__ until another part
//yelled __No__ and shouted it down with determination to bring her back,
//only that part’s voice was getting tired and the other part seemed tireless.
//Another part of his mind insisted on reviewing what he’d said to Professor
//McGonagall and Dad and Mum, even though he’d only been trying to get them out
//of there as quickly as possible and had been running on limited mental energy.
//As though somehow he could have done better, by an act of his defective will.
//What would be left of his relationship with his parents now, Harry couldn’t
//guess.

Хлопчик-Що-Вижив-На-Відміну-Від-Своєї-Найкращої-Подруги плентався далі лункими
коридорами до Великої зали. Він був цілковито виснажений, і в його розумі почали
виникати думки на кшталт спогадів про те, як Герміона йшла поряд, і безсловесних
концепцій "`цього більше ніколи не станеться`", доки інша частина не закричала
"`ні`" й не приструнила першу думку твердим рішенням повернути її. Тільки от
голос цієї другої частини все слабшав, а першої був невтомним. Інша частина його
розуму наполягала обміркувати, що саме він сказав був професорці Макґонеґел,
татові й мамі, доки він старався лише прибрати їх звідси якомога швидше, і був
не в найкращому ментальному стані. Ніби варто було щось вигадати, і він своїми
жалюгідними здібностями все б виправив.  Що тепер лишилося від його стосунків з
батьками, Гаррі гадки не мав.

// 16547
//He came finally to a junction where there waited a older boy in green-fringed
//black robes, silently reading a textbook, on the path that anyone would pick if
//they wanted to intercept someone going from the healer’s chambers to the Great
//Hall.
Він нарешті підійшов до перехрестя, де чекав старший хлопець у чорній мантії із
зеленим оздобленням. Той тихо читав книжку, він стояв там, де стояв би кожен,
хто хотів перехопити когось на шляху з шкільної лікарні до Великої зали.

// 16548
//Harry was wearing the Cloak of Invisibility, of course, he’d put it on after
//leaving the office, rendering himself immune to almost all forms of magical
//detection. There was no point in making it easy for anyone trying to find him
//and kill him. And Harry was almost set to continue past without bothering to
//find out what was going on, when he recognized the Slytherin boy’s face.
Гаррі, звісно, був у Плащі невидимості, він одягнув його, щойно вийшов з
кабінету, ставши невразливим майже до всіх форм магічного пошуку. Не було сенсу
полегшувати комусь задачу знайти та вбити його. Гаррі вже майже вирішив пройти
повз та не марнувати час на спроби зʼясувати, що відбувається, але тоді він
впізнав обличчя слизеринця.

// 16549
//Realization dawned on Harry then. Of course, one of the students who had stayed
//in school over the Easter holiday would naturally have been -
Тоді Гаррі все збагнув. Ну звісно, одним з учнів, що лишалися в школі на
Великодневі свята був...

// 16550
//“You were waiting for me,” Harry said out loud, without removing the Cloak.
-- Ти чекав на мене, -- сказав Гаррі вголос, не знімаючи Плаща.

// 16551
//The Slytherin boy jerked back, hitting his head against the wall, his
//fifth-year Charms textbook dropping from his hands, before he looked up with
//wide eyes.
Слизеринець відсахнувся, вдарився головою об стіну, підручник з чарів для
пʼятого класу випав йому з рук, а тоді він підвів широко розплющені очі.

// 16552
//“You’re -”
-- Ви...

// 16553
//“Invisible. Yes. Say what you mean to say.”
-- Невидимий. Так. Кажи, що хотів сказати.

// 16554
//Lesath Lestrange scrambled to his feet, a position of attention, then blurted
//out, “My lord, did I do the right thing - I thought you would not wish me to
//step forward before all those others, that they might suspect our connection -
//I thought, surely if you wished my help you would call on me -”
Лесат Лестранж звівся на ноги, весь виявляв увагу, і випалив:

-- Мій лорде, чи правильно я вчинив... я гадав, що ви не хотіли, щоб я робив
крок уперед перед рештою учнів, бо тоді вони могли б запідозрити про наш
звʼязок... я вирішив, що якби ви хотіли моєї допомоги, ви б покликали мене...

// 16555
//It was amazing how many different ways there were to kill your best friend by
//being stupid.
Дивовижно, скільки існувало різноманітних способів убити найкращу подругу своєю
дурістю.

// 16556
//“I -” Lesath hesitated, then said in a small voice, “I was wrong, wasn’t I?”
-- Я... -- Лесат завагався й сказав жалюгідним голосом: -- Я помилився, так?

// 16557
//“You acted exactly as you should have, under the circumstances. It is I who was
//a fool.”
-- Ти дійв саме так, як мав діяти за цих обставин. Це я був дурнем.

// 16558
//“I’m sorry, my lord,” whispered Lesath.
-- Мені шкода, мій лорде, -- прошепотів Лесат.

// 16559
//“If you __had__ come with me, would you have been able to kill the troll?”
//It wasn’t even the correct question, the correct question was whether Harry
//himself would have considered Lesath as sufficient and flown out sixty seconds
//earlier, but still…
-- Якби ти __пішов__ зі мною, ти зміг би вбити троля?

Насправді, це було неправильне питання. Правильним питанням було, чи сам Гаррі
вирішив би, що Лесата достатньо, і чи вилетів би він на шістдесят секунд раніше,
та все одно...

// 16560
//“I… I’m not sure, my lord… I am not much welcome to duelling practices in
//Slytherin, I have not learned the gestures to the Killing Curse - should I
//study those arts to better serve you, my lord?”
-- Я... Я не певен, мій лорде... мене не дуже терплять на дуельних практиках
Слизерину, я не вивчив жести смертельного прокляття... чи маю я вивчити ці
мистецтва, щоб ліпше служити вам, мій лорде?

// 16561
//“I continue to insist that I am not your lord,” Harry said.
-- Я й далі наполягаю, що я не твій лорд, -- сказав Гаррі.

// 16562
//“Yes, my lord.”
-- Так, мій лорде.

// 16563
//“Although,” Harry said, “and this is not any kind of order, just a remark,
//anyone ought to know how to defend themselves, especially you. I’m sure the
//Defense Professor would help you with that on general principles, if you
//asked.”
-- Хоча, -- сказав Гаррі, -- і це жодним чином не наказ, просто заувага.
Будь-хто має вміти захищатися, а особливо ти. Я певен, що професор із захисту
допоможе тобі з цим на загальних засадах, якщо ти попросиш.

// 16564
//Lesath Lestrange bowed and said, “Yes, my lord, I will follow your orders if I
//can, my lord.”
Лесат Лестранж вклонився й сказав:

-- Так мій лорде, я докладу всіх зусиль, щоб виконати ваші накази, мій лорде.

// 16565
//Harry would have complained about being misunderstood, if he hadn’t been
//understood perfectly.
//! 33%
Гаррі б пожалівся, що його неправильно зрозуміли, якби його не зрозуміли
абсолютно правильно.

// 16566
//Lesath left.

// 16567
//Harry stared at the wall.

// 16568
//He’d honestly thought that he’d already figured out all the different ways that
//he’d been stupid, after spending half a day thinking about it.

// 16569
//Apparently this had just been more overconfidence on his part.

// 16570
//__Do we understand what we did wrong?__ his Slytherin side said coldly.

// 16571
//__Yes,__ Harry thought.

// 16572
//__Your ethical qualms don’t even make sense. You’re not tricking Lesath.
//You did exactly what Lesath thinks you did. You wouldn’t have to make excuses
//for why Lesath was helping you, you could just say you were calling in the debt
//from rescuing him from bullies, there were six witnesses to that. Hermione died
//because you forgot about an extremely valuable resource, and you forgot about
//Lesath because… why?__

// 16573
//__Because having Lesath Lestrange for a minion seemed sort of
//Dark-Lordish?__ Hufflepuff said in a small mental voice. __I mean… that
//decision was probably mostly me…__

// 16574
//Harry’s Slytherin side didn’t answer that in words, just radiated contempt and
//flashed an image of Hermione’s corpse.

// 16575
//__Stop it!__ Harry screamed internally.

// 16576
//__Next time,__ Slytherin said icily, __I suggest that we spend more
//time worrying about what is efficient and effective, and less time worrying
//about what seems sort of Dark-Lordish.__

// 16577
//__Point made,__ Harry thought, __I will.__

// 16578
//__No, you won’t,__ said Slytherin. __You’ll come up with more
//rationalisations for your petty qualms. You’ll start listening to me after your
//__next __friend dies.__

// 16579
//Harry was starting to worry that he was going insane. The conversations he had
//with the voices in his head weren’t usually like this.

// 16585
//“How is Mr. Potter doing?” demanded Professor Quirrell. There was a tension
//about the man, you could not quite call it __concern,__ more like an
//ambusher measuring the time to strike. The Grangers had hardly left with Madam
//Pomfrey before the Defense Professor had knocked upon the door to her office
//and then entered without waiting for her answer, and spoken before she could
//say a word. Part of Minerva wondered distantly whether Harry Potter had picked
//up that habit from his Defense Professor, being unaware of others’ pain when
//there was something else on his mind, or if it was only a childish flaw which
//this man had somehow failed to grow out of.

// 16586
//“Mr. Potter has ceased guarding Miss Granger’s body,” she said, putting some of
//the chill she felt into her voice. She felt certain that the Defense Professor
//was not experiencing as much grief as she was, the man had spoken not a single
//word of Hermione Granger. For __him__ to put demands on her - “I believe
//he has gone down to dinner.”

// 16587
//“I am not asking after the boy’s __physical__ state! Have you - has he -”
//Professor Quirrell made a sharp gesture, as though to indicate a concept for
//which he had no words.

// 16588
//“Not particularly,” she said. She was around thirty seconds away from ordering
//the Defense Professor out of her office.

// 16589
//Professor Quirrell began to pace within the small confines of her office. “Miss
//Granger was the only one whose worries he truly heeded - with her gone - all
//checks on the boy’s recklessness are removed. I see it now. Who else is there?
//Mr. Longbottom? Mr. Potter does not pretend that they are peers. Flitwick? His
//goblin blood would only cry for vengeance. Mr. Malfoy, if he were returned? To
//what end? Snape? A walking disaster. Dumbledore? Pfah. Events are already set
//for catastrophe, they must be steered along some course they would not
//naturally go. Who might Mr. Potter heed, who would not ordinarily speak to him?
//Cedric Diggory has taught him, but what would Mr. Diggory say in advice? An
//unknown. Mr. Potter spent long in speech with Remus Lupin. To him I have paid
//little heed. Would Lupin know the words to speak, the act which must be done,
//the sacrifice which must be made to change the boy’s course?” Professor
//Quirrell whirled on her. “Did Remus Lupin comfort those in grief or stay those
//moved to rash deeds, during his time with the Order of the Phoenix?”
//! 68%

// 16590
//“It is not a poor thought,” she said slowly. “I believe that Mr. Lupin was
//often a voice of restraint to James Potter in his Hogwarts days.”

// 16591
//“James Potter,” said Professor Quirrell, his eyes narrowing. “The boy is not
//much like James Potter. Are you confident in the success of this plan? No, that
//is the wrong question, we are not limited to a single plan. Are you certain
//that this plan will be __enough,__ that we need essay no others? Asked in
//such fashion, the question answers itself. The path leading to disaster must be
//averted along every possible point of intervention.” The Defense Professor had
//resumed pacing the confines of her office, reaching one wall, turning on his
//heel, pacing to the other.

// 16592
//“My apologies, Professor,” she did not bother keeping the sharpness from her
//voice, “but I have quite reached my limits for the day. You may go.”

// 16593
//“__You__.” Professor Quirrell spun, and she found herself gazing directly
//into eyes of icy blue. “__You__ would be the first one I would think of
//after Miss Granger, to stay the boy from a folly. Have you already done your
//utmost? Of course you have not.”

// 16594
//How __dare__ he suggest that. “If you have nothing more to say, Professor,
//then you __will__ go.”

// 16595
//“Has your confederacy deduced who I really am?” The words were spoken with
//deceptive mildness.

// 16596
//“Yes, in fact. Now -”

// 16597
//Pure magic, pure power crashed into the room like a flash of lightning, like a
//thunderclap echoing about her ears that deafened her other senses, the papers
//on her desk blown aside not by any conjured wind but by the sheer raw force of
//arcane might.

// 16598
//Then the power subsided, leaving only Hermione Granger’s death certificates
//drifting down through the air to the floor.

// 16599
//“I am David Monroe, who fought Voldemort,” the man said, still in mild tones.
//“Heed my words. The boy cannot be allowed to continue in this state of mind. He
//will become __dangerous__. It is possible that you have already done
//everything you can. Yet I find this a very rare event indeed, and more often
//said than done. I suspect rather that you have only done what you customarily
//do. I cannot truly comprehend what drives others to break their bounds, since I
//never had them. People remain surprisingly passive when faced with the prospect
//of death. Fear of public ridicule or losing one’s livelihood is more likely to
//drive men to extremes and the breaking of their customary habits. On the other
//side of the war, the Dark Lord had excellent results from the Cruciatus Curse,
//judiciously used on Marked servants who cannot escape punishment except by
//success, with no reasonable efforts accepted. Imagine their state of mind
//within yourself, and ask yourself whether you have truly done __all that
//you can__ to wrench Harry Potter from his course.”
// hedrok: "break bounds" - копія в 093:16647 "вийти за свої межі"

// 16600
//“I am a Gryffindor and not much given to being moved by fear,” she snapped
//back. “__You__ will exercise courtesy within my office!”

// 16601
//“I find fear an excellent motivation, and indeed it is fear that moves me now.
//You-Know-Who, for all his horror, still abided by certain boundaries. It is my
//professional judgment, speaking as a learned wizard almost on par with
//Dumbledore or He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, that the boy could join the ranks of
//those whose rituals are inscribed upon the tombstones of countries. This is not
//an idle worry, McGonagall, I have already heard words to produce the gravest
//apprehensions.”

// 16602
//“Are you mad? You think that Mr. Potter could - this is ridiculous. Mr. Potter
//cannot possibly -”

// 16603
//A wordless image crossed her mind of a patch of glass on a steel ball.

// 16604
//“- Mr. Potter __would__ not do such a thing!”

// 16605
//“His deliberate choice is not required. Wizards rarely set out to invoke their
//own dooms. Mr. Potter may not strike you as malicious. Does he strike you as
//reckless once he is resolved upon a goal? I say again that I have specific
//reason for the gravest __possible__ concerns!”

// 16606
//“Have you spoken to the Headmaster of this?” she said slowly.

// 16607
//“That would be worse than pointless. Dumbledore cannot reach the boy. At best
//he is wise enough to know this and make things no worse. I lack the requisite
//frame of mind. __You__ are the one who - but I see that you still look for
//others to save you.” The Defense Professor turned from her, and strode to the
//door. “I think I shall consult with Severus Snape. The man may be a walking
//disaster, but he knows the fact, and he may possess a greater understanding of
//that boy’s mood. As for you, madam, imagine yourself at the end of your life,
//knowing that Britain - but no, Britain is not your true country, is it? Imagine
//yourself at the end of your life as the darkness eats through the fading walls
//of Hogwarts, knowing that your students will die with you, remembering this day
//and realizing there was something else you could have done.”
