//Even as Harry had raised the gun, he’d __known__ he was making a mistake,
//his forebrain saw it and tried to stop his hand, but somehow the sick certainty
//didn’t propagate fast enough to prevent his finger from pulling the trigger -

// 18995
//The echo of the shots died away within the graveyard.

// 18996
//A fraction of a second before Harry had pulled the trigger, Voldemort had
//jabbed his wand downward, and a wide wall of dirt had shot up between them from
//the graveyard earth, intercepting all three bullets.

// 18997
//An instant after that, pain flared in Harry’s scar, a crawling feeling came
//close to his skin; and then Harry’s pouch, clothes, gun, everything except his
//wand disappeared, leaving him naked but for the wand still in his right hand,
//and the glasses he’d Charmed to stick to his nose. The steel ring upon his left
//pinky finger was yanked off hard enough to scrape skin, taking the Transfigured
//jewel with it.

// 18998
//“That,” said the voice of Voldemort from behind the dirt wall, “was
//__absolutely__ predictable. Do you really think I would shout it aloud for
//you to hear, if my immortality were disrupted? Really, stupid child? Lower your
//wand, do not raise it up again at any time, or you die upon the spot.”

// 18999
//Harry swallowed, and pointed his wand downward. “You would have been
//disappointed in me,” Harry said, his own voice now unusually high, “if I’d
//missed an opportunity like that, I mean.” There was no time to think, and
//Harry’s mouth was operating on autopilot for trying to placate evil overlords
//that might have paternal feelings for you and whom you’d just failed to
//assassinate.

// 19000
//Voldemort stepped around from behind the dirt wall, smiling that horrible smile
//that seemed to contain too many teeth. “I promised not to raise my hand or wand
//against you, child, if you did not raise your hand or wand against me.”

// 19001
//“I used bullets,” Harry said, his voice still high. “That’s not a fist or a
//spell.”

// 19002
//“My curse thinks differently. That is the puzzle piece that you missed. Did you
//think I would leave the peace between us to mere fortune? Before I created you,
//I invoked a curse upon myself and all other Tom Riddles who would descend from
//me. A curse to enforce that none of us would threaten the others’ immortality,
//so long as the other made no attempt upon our own. Typical of that ridiculous
//fiasco, the curse seems to have ended up binding me, but taking no hold upon
//the infant with his self so lost.” A low, lethal chuckle. “__But you
//tried to end my true life jusst then, sstupid child. Now cursse iss lifted, and
//I may kill you any time I wissh.__”

// 19003
//“I see,” Harry said. He did see; __that__ was why Voldemort had told him
//about his horcrux system in the first place, just to set up the moment when
//Harry knowingly tried to violate his immortality. Harry’s mind was frantically
//churning through options, none of which seemed helpful. His pouch, his clothes,
//Harry saw by the moonlight that they all now lay in another heap by the altar,
//out of reach. “And now you kill me?” Harry still had his wand, presumably the
//Dark Lord couldn’t cast his own magic on that, or his glasses, because of the
//disharmony. __Cast my own spell first? No, Voldemort just jabs his wand
//downward to make another shield, then shoots me - what else is there? WHAT
//ELSE?__

// 19004
//“Still a fool. If no further matters remained between us, I would already have
//killed you.” The dirt wall crumbled at another gesture of the wand, and
//Voldemort moved smoothly back toward the heap of items by the altar. The Dark
//Lord stretched out a hand, and the diary of Roger Bacon flew to him.
//“__Thiss iss, indeed, horcrux of girl-child, my ssuperior verssion.__” In
//his other hand appeared a parchment. ”__Thiss iss ritual for
//ressurrecting her, if it musst be done again. Insstructionss are honesst, no
//trapss. Remember that girl-child’ss sspirit cannot float free like ghosst,
//Ressurrection Sstone iss my horcrux, not herss. Do not losse her horcrux, or
//her sspirit may be trapped within it.__” Voldemort reached down, picked up
//Harry’s pouch, fed both the diary and the parchment into it. ”__Remember
//that, in casse something goess wrong with next movess.__”

// 19005
//“I don’t understand what is happening,” Harry said. There was nothing else
//left. “Please explain to me.”

// 19006
//The Dark Lord was now regarding Harry with a grim look. “__When
//girl-child died, wass in company of sschool’ss Sseer, heard prophecy sspoken
//that you would become force of vasst desstruction. You would become threat
//beyond imagination, beyond apocalypsse. That iss why I went to ssuch lengthss
//to undo my killing of girl-child, keep it undone.”__
//! 53%

// 19007
//“Are,” what “are you sure,” what.

// 19008
//“__Dare not ssay sspecificss to you. Prophecy I heard of mysself led me
//to fulfill it. Have not forgotten that dissasster.__” Voldemort backed further
//away from Harry, red slitted eyes fixed upon the Boy-Who-Lived, gun unwavering
//in the left hand. ”__All thiss, all I have done, iss to ssmassh that
//desstiny at every point of intervention. If ssome fate makess me fail in what
//comess next, idiot-child of foretold desstruction, then you musst kill
//yoursself to ssave girl-child. Elsse all you claim to value diess by your own
//hand.__”

// 19009
//“I,” Harry’s voice went up an octave, “I,” another octave, “I __really
//really wouldn’t do that, seriously!”__

// 19010
//“__Ssilence, fool. Remain ssilent unlesss given leave by me to sspeak.
//Keep your wand pointed down and do not raisse it unlesss told. Elsse you die
//upon the sspot, and mark that I ssaid that in Parsseltongue.”__ Voldemort
//reached into the altar again.

// 19011
//For a second Harry’s mind couldn’t process what he was seeing, and then he saw
//that Voldemort was holding a human arm, severed near the shoulder; it seemed
//too thin, that arm.

// 19012
//The Dark Lord pressed his wand to the flesh above the severed arm’s elbow, and
//the fingers twitched, twitched like they were alive; by dim moonlight Harry saw
//a darker mark appear on that flesh, just above the elbow.

// 19013
//Seconds later the first hooded figure appeared inside the graveyard with the
//popping sound of an Apparition. A moment after that came another pop, and then
//another.

// 19014
//The hooded figures wore silver skull masks, and moonlight fled from the robes
//beneath them.

// 19015
//“Master!” cried one of the black robes, the third to arrive. The voice was of
//peculiar timbre, from behind the silver skull mask. “Master - it has been so
//long - we had lost hope -”

// 19016
//“Silence!” shouted the high voice of the Dark Lord Voldemort. Every trace of
//Professor Quirrell was now gone from the too-tall figure. “Train your wand upon
//the Boy-Who-Lived, and watch him! Do not be distracted, not by anything! Stun
//him at once if he moves, if he begins to speak!”

// 19017
//More pops. Between graves, behind a tree, in all the shadowy spaces, more black
//robes were Apparating, all hooded and masked. Some of them voiced exclamations
//of joy, many of those sounding rather forced; others moved forwards as though
//to greet their Master. Voldemort gave them all the same instruction, except
//that some were commanded to Cruciate Harry Potter if he moved, others to
//restrain the Boy-Who-Lived if he moved, others told to fire hexes and curses,
//others told to cancel his magic.

// 19018
//Thirty-seven pops, Harry counted before the black robes and skull masks seemed
//to stop arriving.

// 19019
//All of them were now holding their wands pointed at Harry, aligned in a
//semicircle before him, where they wouldn’t get into each other’s lines of fire.

// 19020
//Harry continued pointing his wand downward, insofar as he had been told that,
//if he tried to raise it, he would die. He remained silent, insofar as he had
//been told that if he tried to speak, he would die. He tried not to shiver in
//the falling night temperatures, for he was naked, and it was getting colder.

// 19021
//__You know,__ said the last voice within Harry, the voice of hope,
//__I think this is getting pretty bad even by my standards.__
