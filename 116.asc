//At first Anna had been gratified to see the final Quidditch Cup go on so long -
//as a Gryffindor she was a bystander at the House Cup thing, it wasn’t like
//Gryffindor ever won. In contrast, last year’s World Cup of Quidditch, to which
//her family had bought some very expensive tickets, had been over in __ten
//minutes__ which was __awful__. Modern Quidditch games had become too short,
//the Snitch caught much too quickly. It was a widely-talked problem among
//aficionados: broomstick enchantments had advanced, while the Snitch stayed the
//same regulation speed, with the result that Quidditch games had become shorter
//and shorter. At professional levels the sport of Quidditch had been reduced to
//a contest of who had the deepest pockets for their Seeker’s experimental racing
//broom, and the rest of the players might as well have been watching from the
//stands.

// 19348
//Everyone knew something had to be done, the situation had been getting worse
//for __centuries__ and now it was__ intolerable.__ But the
//International Confederation of Wizards’ Quidditch Committee was mired in all
//the usual acrimony of the I.C.W., screaming disputes between Germans and
//Bulgarians, and somehow nobody could agree on __exactly__ how to fix the
//rules. To Anna the correct course seemed obvious, just make the Snitch fast
//enough to restore the four-hour or five-hour games of the early nineteenth
//century and the Golden Age of Quidditch. Except the Belgians thought the
//duration of a professional game should be two hours like in __La Belle
//____Ă‰poque__ when Belgium had dominated Quidditch, and the lunatic
//Italians wanted to go back to the week-long Quidditch games of the fourteenth
//century, and Britain’s even crazier blood purists kept on talking up the
//occasional day-long Quidditch match as proof that broomsticks couldn’t
//__really __have improved since everything was better in the old days
//__which was not how the Interdict of Merlin worked.__

// 19349
//She was one hundred percent on the side of Harry Potter that it was time for
//Hogwarts to give up on those gibbering slowpokes and just change the rules,
//starting here and now. But not by __eliminating the Snitch,__ that was
//going all the way back to __eleventh century Kwidditch.__ It didn’t matter
//if Headmistress Hufflepuff had first introduced the innovation because one of
//her students had wanted to play the game but not been suited to the usual
//roles. Snitches had caught on internationally because it was more exciting when
//the game could always end in the next minute.

// 19350
//Anna had been arguing this viewpoint at the top of her lungs for the last
//thirty minutes, quite forgetting to pay attention to the game. Thanks to a
//lucky coincidence of seating she’d been near the Boy-Who-Lived and his sign,
//and hence she’d managed to stake out her position right from the start.

// 19351
//She was aware, in the back of her mind, that if the Quidditch rules really
//__did__ change starting here and now, then this was the __most
//important thing she’d ever do.__ She could almost __feel__ the pressure of
//Time twisting around her as though the fate of Quidditch Itself were being
//settled this very day, and she was standing close to the center of it… though
//she hadn’t gotten high-enough scores in Divination to actually sense anything
//like that, of course.

// 19352
//She hardly noticed when at one point the Boy-Who-Lived stood up to go to the
//bathroom.

// 19353
//The Boy-Who-Lived did catch her eye when he trudged back; Harry Potter looked a
//bit tired and wobbly, though his uniform appeared as trim as if he’d just
//changed into a new one.

// 19354
//She noticed half an hour later on, when Harry Potter seemed to sway a bit, and
//then hunch over, his hands going to cover up his forehead; it looked like he
//was prodding at his forehead scar. The thought made her slightly worried;
//everyone knew there was __something going on__ with Harry Potter, and if
//Potter’s scar was hurting him then it was possible that a sealed horror was
//about to burst out of his forehead and eat everyone. She dismissed that
//thought, though, and continued to explain Quidditch facts to the historically
//ignorant at the top of her lungs.

// 19355
//She definitely noticed when Harry Potter stood up, hands still on his forehead,
//and dropped his hands to reveal that his famous lightning-bolt scar was now
//blazing red and inflamed. It was __bleeding,__ with the blood dripping
//down Potter’s nose.

// 19356
//She stopped talking mid-sentence. Other people turned to look at what she was
//staring at.

// 19357
//“Professor McGonagall?” Harry Potter said in a wavering voice. There were tears
//in the corners of his eyes, which shocked her; the Boy-Who-Lived did
//__not__ seem like the sort of person who would burst into tears. Harry
//Potter raised his voice further, as though it were hard for him to speak. “Um,
//Professor McGonagall?”

// 19358
//Professor McGonagall turned away from where she was arguing with the Hufflepuff
//Quidditch team. The Head of Gryffindor’s eyes widened in shock, and then she
//was moving people out of her way, almost running. “Harry!” she said. “Your
//__scar!__”

// 19359
//Silence was spreading, in a widening circle.

// 19360
//“I think,” Harry said, his voice still wavering but louder, “I think he’s back.
//I think I’m seeing - through Voldemort’s mind -”

// 19361
//Anna took a step back at You-Know-Who’s name and nearly fell over a bleacher.
//An older boy standing next to her gave a cry of dismay, and then the
//Boy-Who-Lived shrieked even louder.

// 19362
//“HE’S KILLING THEM!” screamed Harry Potter.

// 19363
//Half the Quidditch stadium turned to look at him.

// 19364
//“The ritual!” cried Harry Potter. “Blood of his servants! The blood, the life!
//He summoned them, he took their heads, their blood, the life, to renew his own
//- __THE DARK LORD RISES, VOLDEMORT IS RETURNED!”__

// 19365
//Madam Hooch blew a shrill whistle, and the Quidditch brooms that hadn’t already
//stopped in midair began to slow. For herself she wasn’t sure if this was a
//joke; if it was, Boy-Who-Lived or not, he was in more trouble than she could
//even imagine.

// 19366
//Professor McGonagall raised her wand into position for a Quieting Charm and
//Harry Potter caught her hand.

// 19367
//“Wait -” Harry Potter gasped, his voice lower, but still loud enough that she
//and the people near her could hear clearly. “He can be stopped - I see his
//mind, his mistake - he can be stopped __now__ - __THE WAY IS STILL
//OPEN! SHE’S FOLLOWING HIM! SHE WHO VOLDEMORT SLEW!__” Harry’s voice rose
//further, as Anna’s own mouth fell open in sudden confusion. ”__RETURN!
//RETURN, RETURN, REVIVE AND STOP HIM! STOP HIM, HERMIONE!__”

// 19368
//And then Harry Potter fell silent. He looked around at the people staring at
//him.

// 19369
//She’d just about decided that this had to all be a prank in
//__unbelievably__ poor taste, when a distant but sharp CRACK filled the
//air.

// 19370
//Harry Potter swayed, and fell to his knees, even as her heart jumped into her
//throat. An explosion of excited babble rose around them.

// 19371
//She could still hear the words from Harry Potter’s mouth, as Professor
//McGonagall knelt next to him. “It worked,” Harry Potter gasped aloud, “she got
//him, he’s gone.”

// 19372
//__“What?__” cried Professor McGonagall, then glanced around.
//”__Quiet! Quiet, all of you!__ Harry, what happened?”

// 19373
//Harry Potter was speaking rapidly but loudly. “Voldemort - tried to revive - he
//summoned Death Eaters __and he killed them,__ stole their blood and life -
//Hermione’s body was there, I don’t know why, maybe Voldemort was planning to
//use it for something - Voldemort came back, he resurrected himself, but
//Hermione __followed him back__ and she__ destroyed him,__ he’s gone,
//it’s over. It happened in a graveyard near Hogwarts, it’s,” Harry Potter rose
//to his feet, still swaying, “I think it’s in that direction.” Harry Potter
//pointed in the rough direction the CRACK had come from, “I’m not sure how far.
//The sound from there took twenty seconds to get here, so maybe two minutes on a
//broomstick -”

// 19374
//With a motion so smooth it looked unconscious, Professor McGonagall shifted
//into a stance and said “__Expecto Patronum__.__” __She addressed the
//glowing cat that then appeared. “Go to Albus, tell him he must come at once -”

// 19375
//“Dumbledore’s gone!” cried Harry Potter. “The Headmaster is gone, Professor
//McGonagall! The Dark Lord trapped him, he reversed some kind of trap the
//Headmaster planned and Dumbledore was caught outside Time, he’s gone!”

// 19376
//The horrified babble around them rose in pitch.

// 19377
//“Go to Albus!” Professor McGonagall said to her Patronus.

// 19378
//The moonlit cat only looked at McGonagall sadly, and Anna sucked in her breath
//in sudden horror, feeling like someone had punched her in the stomach. It was
//real, it was all real, this wasn’t a joke.

// 19379
//“Professor McGonagall, Hermione is __alive!__” Harry Potter raised his
//voice again. “She’s really alive and not an Inferius or anything, and she’s
//still there in the graveyard!”

// 19380
//__“A broomstick!”__ Professor McGonagall shouted. She turned to the
//players hovering motionless over the Quidditch field. “I need a broomstick.
//NOW!”

// 19381
//Despite everything, Anna raised a hand in mute protest, then caught herself,
//even as the Ravenclaw and Slytherin Seekers came zooming over (with excellent
//strategic sense, since they weren’t actually doing anything).

// 19382
//Harry Potter was already retrieving another broomstick from his pouch, a
//multi-person one.

// 19383
//Professor McGonagall saw this, and nodded firmly. “You stay here, Mr. Potter,
//unless there is some excellent reason you must be there. I will go at once.”

// 19384
//“You mustn’t!” squeaked Professor Flitwick, who’d shoved his tiny way through
//the crowd, occasionally running under someone’s legs. His eyes were wide, he
//looked as though he wanted to faint. “You have to stay at Hogwarts, Minerva!
//You - you’re the -” Professor Flitwick seemed to be having trouble speaking.

// 19385
//Professor McGonagall spun around to face Professor Flitwick, and then stopped,
//blood draining from her face.

// 19386
//Then she seized the broomstick from Harry Potter’s hand, and presented it to
//the tiny half-goblin Professor. “Filius,” she said crisply. All the incipient
//panic had disappeared from her voice, she now spoke in her crisp Scottish
//accent as though addressing lessons on Monday. “Look for the graveyard of which
//Mr. Potter spoke, find Miss Granger. Apparate her to St. Mungo’s and then stay
//by her.”

// 19387
//“I think -” Harry Potter said hoarsely. “I think Transfiguration might have
//been used in combat there - Professor Quirrell tried to fight Voldemort - take
//precautions -”

// 19388
//Filius Flitwick nodded without halting in getting on the broomstick.

// 19389
//“Professor Quirrell’s dead!” wailed Harry Potter. The anguish in his voice
//carried clearly. “He’s dead! The Dark Lord killed him! His body -” Harry Potter
//choked up. “It’s there, in the graveyard.”

// 19390
//She stumbled back again, feeling it like another punch in her gut. Professor
//Quirrell had been - one of her favorite Professors, __ever__, he’d made
//her rethink everything she’d believed about Slytherin, she’d known in some
//distant way that he was probably going to die very soon but to hear that he was
//really, truly dead…

// 19391
//The Boy-Who-Lived sat down on the bench, as if his legs couldn’t support him
//anymore.

// 19392
//Professor McGonagall turned to the crowd, touching her wand to her throat.
//“QUIDDITCH IS OVER,” her amplified voice boomed out. “GO BACK TO YOUR
//DORMITORIES -”

// 19393
//“__Don’t!__” screamed Harry Potter.

// 19394
//Professor McGonagall turned to look at him.

// 19395
//Tears were leaking down the Boy-Who-Lived’s cheeks, he looked like the
//interruption had surprised himself as much as it had surprised anyone else. “It
//was Professor Quirrell’s last plot,” Harry Potter said, his voice breaking. The
//Boy-Who-Lived looked at the Quidditch players who had now flown to nearby, as
//though speaking to them directly. “His last plot.”

// 19396
//Harry Potter was floated off by Professor McGonagall to the infirmary. The
//other Professors ran off to oversee who-knew-what, leaving only Professors
//Sinistra and Hooch behind. At the stadium, rumors ran wild; Anna repeated
//everything she could remember hearing as best she could. Something had happened
//to Dumbledore, some Death Eaters had been summoned and killed (no, Harry Potter
//hadn’t said which ones), Professor Quirrell had gone out to face the Dark Lord
//and died for it, You-Know-Who had returned and died again, Professor Quirrell
//was dead, he was dead.

// 19397
//In time most of the students wandered off back to their dormitories, to sleep
//if they could.

// 19398
//Anna stayed in the stadium, and watched the rest of the game, ignoring her
//body’s need for sleep, and her eyes that often blurred with tears.

// 19399
//The Ravenclaw team put up a valiant fight.

// 19400
//But there was no Quidditch team anywhere that could’ve defeated the Slytherins
//that day.

// 19401
//Dawn was tinging the sky when the Slytherins won their final game, the
//Quidditch Cup, and the House Cup.
